I may not talk alot here, because the topic is pretty straight forward and speaks for its self.

```javascript
const one = 12;
console.log("hello", one);
```

prints
`hello 12`

Peace out!!!

### Get the List of Department without Manager

To get all the department that has no manager assign to them we have to make use of `joins` to join the related tables we need to make use.

We would ben using three tables `departments`, `locations` and `countries`.
Run the code below to see it in action.

```sql
select l.city || c.country_name, d.department_name
from departments d, locations l, countries c
where d.location_id = l.location_id
and d.manager_id is null;
```

```sql
SELECT MAX(ROW_KEY) FROM CS_00_CUS_CTC_X;
--
ALTER TABLE CS_00_CUS ENABLE ALL TRIGGERS;
--
SELECT * FROM CS_00_DCS
WHERE DOC_K NOT IN
(SELECT ROW_KEY FROM CS_00_DCR WHERE CUS_TP_DM = 'J')
AND CUS_K = '1014625';
```

That would be all for today.
